              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The official implementation of our paper: \
**Towards Synergistic, Generalized and Efficient Dual-System for Robotic Manipulation**

#### Overview of RoboDual:
> Our objective is to develop a synergistic dual-system framework which supplements the generalizability of large-scale pre-trained generalist with the efficient and task-specific adaptation of specialist. (a) The fast specialist policy obsesses real-time and accurate control by aid of the slow yet generalized outcome from the generalist one with large-scale data. (b) RoboDual exhibits significant improvement in terms of performance and efficiency over a single standalone option and surpasses previous state-of-the-arts in the real-robot setting.

## :fire: Highlight

<div id="top" align="center">
<p align="center">
<img src="assets/model_arch.png" width="1000px" >
</p>
</div>

- **[Auto-regressive Generalist + DIffusion Action Specialist**] We introduce a novel approach that integrates generalist and specialist policies into a synergistic framework, dubbed :gemini:RoboDual, following a **dual-system** spirit.
- **[Decoupled Training & Input]** The framework facilitates the flexible integration of diverse modalities and allows for the deconstruction of the two models on the aspect of training data, thereby enhancing their individual strengths and capabilities.

### Current Endeavors on Dual-systems

The trend of dual-systems for robotics is shown below. In particular, *Asynchronous* implementations include:
- [Helix](https://www.figure.ai/news/helix) from Figure
- [HiRT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05273) from Tsinghua
- [LCB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04798) from UC Berkeley
- **RoboDual** (This work)

<div id="top" align="center">
<p align="center">
<img src="assets/dual_system_timeline.png" width="1000px" >
</p>
</div>

> - Following RoboDual, the architecture of dual-systems in robotics converges to the 'VLM + Diffusion Transformer' paradigm.
> - Asynchronous inference with dual-system allows a more *decoupled* design and enables more flexible and scalable reasoning.
> - Beyond latents, explicit representations (*e.g.,* coarse action output from the System-2 as in RoboDual) should also be explored!

### :one: Generalist Training
- Our generalist model is built upon OpenVLA, first change ```vla_path``` to your local path of OpenVLA model.
- By default, we employ parameter efficient fine-tuning with LoRA rank 32.
- Then initiate triaining with 8 GPUs:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nnodes 1 --nproc-per-node 8 vla-scripts/train_generalist_calvin.py \
                                 --dataset_name "calvin" \
                                 --run_root_dir "run_log" \
```

### :two: Specialist Training
- We do not train generalist with the specialist with an end-to-end manner and find it works equally well on CALVIN. To further train generalist, modify ```freeze_slow = False``` in the config.
- Start training (100k steps) on CALVIN with 8 GPUs:
```bash
torchrun --standalone --nnodes 1 --nproc-per-node 8 vla-scripts/train_spacialist_calvin.py \
                                 --num_inference_steps 5 \       # sampling steps for DiT
                                 --cond_drop_chance 0.1 \        # condition drop chance for calssifier-free guidance
                                 --with_depth True \             # use depth input
                                 --with_gripper True \           # use gripper-view inputs (both RGB and depth)
                                 --with_tactile True \           # use visuo-tactile input
                                 --batch_size 8 \                # fine-tuning batch size
                                 --learning_rate 1e-4 \          # fine-tuning learning rate
                                 --dataset_name "calvin" \
                                 --run_root_dir "run_log" \
```

### :three: Evaluation <a name="Evaluation"></a>
> First set your ```CALVIN_ROOT``` environment variable wtih:
```bash

- Start evaluation on CALVIN (multi-GPU is also supported):
```bash
torchrun --standalone --nnodes 1 --nproc-per-node 1 vla-scripts/evaluate_calvin.py \
                                 --generalist_path "/path/to/calvin_generalist" \
                                 --specialist_path "/path/to/calvin_specialist" \
                                 --with_depth \                 # use depth input
                                 --with_gripper \               # use gripper-view inputs (both RGB and depth)
                                 --with_cfg \                   # enable classifier-free guidance
                                 --log_dir calvin
```
